[[file:PELT.lsignals.R]] computes [[file:PELT.lsignals.rds]]

[[file:figure-PELT-lsignals.R]] visualizes those results:

Comparison between pdpa, penmap, crops in terms of number of selected
models shows that penmap/pdpa are mostly consistent whereas crops
sometimes selects fewer models.

Finally timings of the different methods

[[file:FPOP.lsignals.R]] computes full path for LOPART data. (max data ~= 40,000)

[[file:FPOP.neuroblastoma.R]] does the same for neuroblastoma data but
this is less interesting because it is smaller by a factor of 10 (~
4,000 max data).
